# Northcoders News API

# Database connection

To connect to the databases in the db folder of this project, you will need to create two .env files to direct connections to the correct environment variables. For testing, create a .env.test file to set PGDATABASE=nc_news_test. For development, create an .env.development file setting PGDATABASE=nc_news. Both files should be included in the .gitignore.
